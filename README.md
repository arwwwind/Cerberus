# Cerberus

This is an official starter Turborepo.

## Quick Start

Run the following command in the root and all the apps in /apps:

```sh
npm i
```
Once required dependencies are installed. From the root of the application run.

```sh
npm run dev
```

- Make sure you have set .env variables correctly.

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `frontend`: a [React.js](https://react.dev/) app
- `backend`: [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) app

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
npm build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
npm dev
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
